# Mini-AGI-Core Project

## Overview
This is the repository for the Mini-AGI-Core project, a small-scale artificial general intelligence (AGI) system, built with Quarkus framework using Kotlin and managed with Gradle. The project aims to develop AGI capabilities such as natural language processing, learning algorithms, knowledge organization, and decision-making processes.

### Is this project supposed to be a serious attempt at building an AGI?
No, this project is not meant to be a serious attempt at building an AGI. It is meant to be a learning experience for the project maintainer with the goal of getting some actual work done in the process.
